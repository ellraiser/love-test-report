# love-test-report
Basic github action to dump the report output generated by [love-test](https://github.com/ellraiser/love-test) into a github action

The action will look for specific header comment in the markdown in the format of:  
`<!-- PASSED 32 || FAILED 1 || SKIPPED 0 || TIME 0.004 -->`  
This is then used to set the totals for the overview + badge
