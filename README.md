# love-test-report
Basic github action to dump the report output generated by [love-test](https://github.com/ellraiser/love-test) into a github action

Example usage:
```yaml
- name: Love Test Report
  uses: ellraiser/love-test-report@main
  with:
    name: Love Testsuite Linux
    title: linux-test-report
    path: testing/output/lovetest_runAllTests.md
```

The 3 action parameters are:
- name (name for the report shown on the page)
- title (name for the report shown in the sidebar)
- path (path to the md file made by love-test)

The action will look for specific header comment in the markdown in the format of:  
`<!-- PASSED 32 || FAILED 1 || SKIPPED 0 || TIME 0.004 -->`  
This is then used to set the totals for the overview + badge

This action won't generate checks on public PRs due to Github Action restrictions on write access in actions.
